# Hadleigh-s-Spotify-API-Project
Code for a custom website for playing around with the Spotify API

Clone the repository, navigate to the spottest2 directory, install dependencies, and run app.js!

Currently the main page and analytics page are functional, with more to come as I add to this project in my free time.
