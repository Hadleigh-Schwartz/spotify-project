# Hadleigh-s-Spotify-API-Project
Code for a custom website for playing around with the Spotify API

Currently the main page and analytics page are functional - they are just simple ways for me to practice Node.js, HTML, CSS, and the Spotify API usage. I plan to add more interesting features in my free time.
